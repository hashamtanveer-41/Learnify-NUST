# Problem Statement — Learnify NUST

NUST students face significant challenges in accessing structured, reliable, and course-relevant learning resources outside the classroom.

While high-quality educational content exists online, it is often scattered, unorganized, and misaligned with NUST course structures. Students are forced to rely on random YouTube searches, WhatsApp groups, and shared Google Drive links, which leads to confusion, wasted time, and inconsistent learning outcomes.

# Key Problems Identified

## ❌ Lack of Centralization
Academic resources are spread across multiple platforms with no single trusted hub.

## ❌ Unstructured Learning
Online content is not organized according to:

### NUST course outlines

### Sections / modules

### Semester timelines

## ❌ Quality & Relevance Issues
Students struggle to identify:

Which videos are actually useful

Which resources are outdated or irrelevant

## ❌ No University-Level Access Control
Existing platforms do not restrict access to university communities, reducing academic focus and trust.

## ❌ Underutilized Senior Knowledge
Valuable insights and explanations from seniors are lost after graduation and not systematically preserved.

# Impact of the Problem

Increased academic stress and inefficiency

Time wasted searching instead of learning

Unequal access to quality resources

Reduced collaboration between batches

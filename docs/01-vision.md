# Vision — Learnify NUST

Learnify NUST aims to become a centralized, student-first digital learning platform for NUST that bridges the gap between classroom teaching and self-paced learning.

The vision is to provide structured, section-wise academic content—curated by seniors, instructors, and trusted sources—so students can learn what is relevant, when it is relevant, without the chaos of scattered resources.
